Once there was a mouse
who lived in a great big house.
The mouse had a pet bug
which lived in his mug.

The mouse wasn't very happy
when his bug jumped into his favourite rug.

The mouse made the bug stay in his mug
and forbade it to go near the rug.
The bug just wouldn't listen
and jumped onto the rug

This time, the mouse was furious
and squashed it with his mug.
